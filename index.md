# Veldrid

Veldrid is a low-level graphics library for .NET. It can be used to create high-performance 2D and 3D games, simulations, tools, and other graphical applications. Unlike most other .NET graphics libraries, Veldrid is designed to be portable, meaning it is not tied to any particular operating system or native graphics API. With Direct3D, Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL, and OpenGL ES backends, applications built with Veldrid can run on all desktop and mobile platforms without modification.

Veldrid is open source software, available under the permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid/blob/master/LICENSE).
